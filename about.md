## Me

My name is Kevin Delord.

I'm an iOS Lead Developer at the Smart Mobile Factory in Berlin, Germany.

Over the years, I've worked on more than 40 projects, and my skills include:

* Swift, Objective-C, C++, C, Ruby, C#, Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Node.JS
* Unit tests, UI tests, code quality and pull requests.
* Database such as Core Data, MagicalRecord or Realm.io.
* Apple certificates and provisioning profiles.
* Team Leading and Teaching (internal talks)

I'm also doing and maintaining few iOS libraries:

* [DKDBManager](https://github.com/kevindelord/DKDBManager): Database manager with a complete CRUD integration.
* [Swift style guide](https://github.com/kevindelord/swift-style-guide): Swift style guide that defines a style, syntax and structure to code in Swift.

You can find my resume right [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/kevin_delord_CV_EN_04_2018.pdf).

## This Blog

This Blog is about working in the iOS world: coding in swift, building, releasing apps, etc.

It tries to bring some light on unclear or complicated topics.

If you see something wrong or deprecated, please contact me! I would be glad to talk about it.

PS: It's all open source, send me a Pull Request :bowtie:

## World Trip

From September 2016 to April 2018, I travelled the world and did post my pictures and stories on that website: [picturemy.world](http://picturemy.world)
